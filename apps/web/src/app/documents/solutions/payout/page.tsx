          Making Deposits Payment methods can be found under both “My Account”
          and “Deposit” pages of the Site. The payment methods made available to
          You may change. Some payment methods may not be available in all
          countries. When choosing a payment method, You agree to the terms of
          that payment method, You agree to any charges that apply, You agree
          that the payment method is valid and You agree that the payment
          account or card belongs to You and that You have the right to use the
          payment method. The billing descriptor for all Bank Card payments will
          show up as ”{process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CASINO_NAME}”. It is unlawful to
          deposit money which has been obtained illegally. We accept payments
          made in EUR, BRL, USD or such other currency as is made available in
          the currency drop down from time to time. You must choose one currency
          as the currency of Your Account. Any payments received in a currency
          other than the one chosen by you will be converted into the currency
          of Your Account at the exchange rate We choose. Also, any exchange
          premiums are payable by you. When payment is made using a credit card,
          We may request a certified copy of that credit card (front and back).
          Please ensure that only the first 6 digits and the last 4 digits of
          the card are visible and that the CVV /CVV2 number on the back of the
          card is also not visible. We do not accept cash directly or cash
          delivered to any payment solution provider.

          Payouts When the outcome of a Game You take part in is determined, or
          when We confirm the result of an event, any winnings will be made
          available to you on Your Account. If We mistakenly credit Your Account
          with winnings that do not belong to You for any reason, these will be
          taken back from Your Account. If You have withdrawn these winnings
          before We become aware of this error, You must immediately inform Us
          and will be required to pay this back. If You do not We will take all
          legal action available to us to recover this debt.
        </li>
        <li>
          Withdrawals You may withdraw any amount up to the “Available to Bet”
          balance in Your Account by issuing a valid notice of withdrawal.
          Notices for withdrawals must be made on the Site only. If You want to
          withdraw all Your funds, You must first cancel any outstanding stakes.
          You agree that funds in Your Account must only be used for playing the
          Games found on the Site. If You request a withdrawal without turning
          over an amount that is equal or more than the amount deposited, We
          reserve the right to enforce a turnover of the full or part of the
          previous deposit(s) made and/or charge a fee on the withdrawal
          requested. We can reject a withdrawal request if We suspect that funds
          are being withdrawn for any fraudulent or money laundering reasons.
          Prior to accepting a withdrawal, We may request that You provide legal
          identification, for example certified copies of passports, ID cards or
          other such documentation as We feel is required in the circumstances.
          We may also carry out phone verification, face verification or other
          such verification as is required to ensure that You are who You say
          You are. If You withdraw an amount which cumulatively exceed EUR 2,000
          (or the equivalent in Your Account currency) We will carry out
          additional verification procedures. We may also carry out these
          verification procedures even in the case of lower withdrawals. Where a
          withdrawal is to be made using a credit card, We may request a
          certified copy of that credit card (front and back). Please ensure
          that only the first 6 digits and the last 4 digits of the card are
          visible and that the CVV /CVV2 number on the back of the card is also
          not visible. All withdrawals must be done through the same payment
          method chosen by You when placing a deposit, unless We decide
          otherwise or are unable to do so. If You deposit using a number of
          payment methods, We reserve the right to split Your withdrawal across
          such payment methods and process each part through the respective
          payment method at Our discretion and in accordance with anti-money
          laundering policies and regulations. The time for a withdrawal request
          to be finalised may vary due to circumstances, however a withdrawal
          attempt should be approved or denied within three (3) business days.
          When a withdrawal is cancelled, the funds are returned back to your
          account and you can make use of those funds accordingly on the
          account. {process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CASINO_NAME} does not assume any
          responsibility for any funds lost during gameplay following a
          withdrawal cancellation either by you or by us. All winnings of 20,000
          EUR or more (excluding progressive jackpot wins), we reserve the right
          to divide the payout into ten installments, paid with 10 per cent of
          the winning sum every month until the full amount is paid out. It is
          at the players discretion to request a withdrawal every month until
          the funds are entirely paid out. We may request that You redirect Your
          withdrawal or cancel it or request that it is redirected to a
          different method of withdrawal in accordance with anti-money
          laundering polices and/or regulations. Cancellation of a withdrawal
          (whether this was made by You or Us) does not entitle You to any
          compensation should You choose to play with the funds in Your Account
          before any withdrawal is completed. We reserve the right to charge an
          administrative fee in the event that You proceed with more than 30
          approved withdrawals/payout requests during one (1) calendar month.
          The administrative fee shall be 2% of the transaction value but no
          less than EUR 5. It shall be charged on each withdrawal following the
          30th withdrawal within each given month.

          Chargebacks If a chargeback on a card or depositing method You have
          used is requested by the payment method provider, We may take the
          following steps:
          <ul className="mt-2 list-inside list-decimal flex flex-col gap-2">
            <li>We may block Your Account.</li>
            <li>We may take any such action as we are entitled to by law.</li>
            <li>
              A chargeback notice may be issued and sent to You, using Your
              registration details.
            </li>
            <li>
              We will use the same payment method as chosen by You when placing
              a deposit in order to issue the chargeback. If We are unable to
              confirm Your identity and the payment method used in order to
              credit the Account in question, We will send out two reminder
              emails which will be subject to an administrative fee of fifty
              (50) euros each, which will be withdrawn from Your Account funds
              unrelated to the chargeback. The balance of Your Account may turn
              negative in cases of chargeback.

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-satoshiBold mt-5">Bonuses and Payouts</h3>
      <ul className="mt-5 list-disc flex flex-col gap-3">
        <li>
          Any Bonus is only available once per: person, family, household,
          address, e-mail address, credit card number, bank account, telephone
          number, computer/device and/or IP address.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any “welcome” Bonuses are only available to new customers who open an
          Account on the Site and who have never held an Account on the Site
          before, have never received a welcome offer of any kind and who are
          invited to take part in a welcome offer by virtue of it being
          specifically offered to them when they register on the Site.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some Bonuses must be manually activated by You in Your Account. Unless
          stated otherwise, You can do this after logging into Your Account and
          depositing the amount required to access the Bonus. Such Bonuses can
          only be activated when real money is available in Your Account. If You
          play with any of Your deposited funds prior to claiming the Bonus,
          lost funds cannot be used to activate the Bonus.
        </li>
        <li>
          When You claim a Bonus, Your real money, the Bonus and all winnings
          generated from them will remain as Bonus money and may not be
          withdrawn or wagered on other products until wagering requirements are
          met.
        </li>
        <li>
          All Bonuses have a wagering requirement that needs to be completed
          within a given time frame before any potential winnings and/or bonuses
          can be withdrawn. Failure to meet the required wagering requirements
          and/or forfeit of an active Bonus for any reason may result in the
          forfeit of all winnings attained from Your real money as well as Your
          Bonus and bonus winnings attained throughout the wagering process of
          the Bonus. Any attempt to withdraw any funds or cash out any placed
          bets prior to the complete fulfilment of the Bonus wagering
          requirement, may result in the Bonus and any winnings attained
          (including winnings that originated from Your real money used to get
          the Bonus) being forfeited. System bets do not count towards the
          wagering requirements. Only bets that have been placed and settled
          during the campaign period will be considered towards the wagering
          requirements. Any bets that are placed and settled outside this period
          will not count.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any evidence or reasonable suspicion that specific bets were placed on
          any Game (i.e. betting in proportions on different outcomes in the
          same hand to create "action") without risk will not qualify for any
          wagering requirement. Examples of bets without risk include betting on
          red and black simultaneously in Roulette, and betting player and
          banker simultaneously in Baccarat. If You are found to be colluding
          with other players, for example, one person betting on the player, the
          other betting on the banker, You will have Your bets cancelled,
          Account closed and all deposits made by You may be forfeited.
        </li>
        <li>
          If You cancel the Bonus You will lose the Bonus and all winnings
          generated from the Bonus.
        </li>
        <li>
          We have the right to refuse any player a Bonus or We may alter the
          Bonus (including cancellation), if We believe that:
          <ul className="mt-2 list-inside list-decimal flex flex-col gap-2">
            <li>
              The Bonus is being abused (Our definition of abuse includes but is
              not limited to a player making use of promotional offers without
              ever risking their own funds).
            </li>
            <li>Technical issues have occurred in relation to the Bonus.</li>
            <li>
              The Bonus is, for any reason, not able to be conducted as planned.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          We offer promotions in good faith to players who use Our services for
          entertainment purposes. We reserve the right to cancel or remove a
          player’s access to these games in the case of suspected abuse of this
          offer and also, should we deem it necessary, to terminate the
          offender’s Account with immediate effect. In the case of an offender’s
          Account being closed, We will not be liable to refund any losses made
          by a player on any Games or to refund any balances on the player’s
          Account. ‘Abuse’ includes but is not limited to using software and/or
          opening multiple accounts in order to gain an unfair advantage on a
          Bonus. In all cases of abuse, We retain the right to withhold all
          winnings and any balances remaining on Your Account.
        </li>
        <li>
          All Bonuses are intended for recreational players and/or as tokens of
          appreciation to Our customers and We therefore reserve the right to
          restrict eligibility to participate in all or part of any Bonus.
        </li>
        <li>
          The maximum withdrawal amount allowed from winnings earned from any
          Bonus or free spins offer before a deposit has been made is €100 or
          the equivalent in Your Account currency.
        </li>
        <li>
          Unless stated otherwise on the specific bonus landing pages, all
          Bonuses in the Casino have got a max bet restriction in place of €5
          per game round or €.50c bet per line (or currency equivalent) and
          failure to adhere to this max bet rule may result in Account closure
          and forfeit of the Bonus and any winnings attained during the wagering
          of the Bonus. For currency equivalent, the following conversion rates
          shall apply unless specifically stated otherwise in the Bonus Terms
          and Conditions:
          <ul className="mt-2 list-inside list-decimal flex flex-col gap-2">
            <li>BRL: R$1 = €4</li>
            <li>USD: €1 = $1</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          12.13 Irregular Play At any time, We may decide to review all records
          and play transactions and/or to monitor Your use of any Bonus or
          Bonuses. If Irregular play is suspected, We reserve the right to
          disqualify You from any free spins promotion or Bonus or other form of
          promotion and/or withhold all deposits and/or winnings and/or close
          Your Account. Irregular play is considered bonus abuse and is not
          permitted on the Site. Irregular play can include (but is not limited
          to): low margin betting, equal betting, zero risk bets or hedge
          betting. These are considered Irregular Play when done purposely to
          exploit Bonuses, in addition the following types of play are
          considered irregular play:
          <ul className="mt-2 list-inside list-decimal flex flex-col gap-2">
            <li>
              Increasing the balance and then changing Your gaming pattern
              significantly (bet, game type, bet structure or other pattern of
              betting) to complete any wagering requirements of any Bonus.
            </li>
            <li>
              Using any betting system or placing even money bets on any game of
              chance; and / or
            </li>
            <li>
              Using the “Double-Up” or gamble feature within a game to increase
              win values.
            </li>
            <li>
              Increasing Your balance after placing high value bets and
              thereafter proceeding to place bets of less than half of the prior
              bet value, in order to meet bonus wagering requirements.
            </li>
            <li>
              Wagering on Games that do not contribute towards wagering
              requirements or Games with a 0% wagering weight applied to them as
              specified in the specific bonus landing page terms.

              deposit.
            </li>
            <li>
              Short term, repetitive and/or unnecessary deposits and withdrawals

            <li>
              Unless provided otherwise in the bonus scheme, all bonuses for
              stakes, winnings, etc. only apply for starting price and fixed
              odds bets and not for multiples, ante-post bets or Tote betting.
              Should multiples be part of a bonus scheme, the respective bonus
              shall relate to the final winnings amount and not to every leg's
              winning.
            </li>
            <li>
              Only one Bonus shall be granted per operation (e.g., bet,
              deposit). Should a Customer qualify for several Bonuses, only the
              Bonus with the highest Bonus amount shall be granted.
