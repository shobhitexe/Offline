      <ul className="mt-5 list-disc flex flex-col gap-3">
        <li>We can refuse to open an Account for any reason.</li>
        <li>
          We can suspend or close Your Account for any breach or suspected
          breach of this Agreement or other valid reason. Upon closure of Your
          Account, the full balance in Your Account will be paid to You unless
          there is a reason for such funds to be withheld.
        </li>
        <li>
          Whilst We understand that mistakes and typos happen, if We find the
          information given at the time of registration to be incorrect, this
          gives Us the right to close Your Account and keep any funds in it.
          Likewise, if You fail to pass any personal identification verification
          procedures We will also close Your Account and withhold any winnings.
        </li>
        <li>
          If You try to open any other Account, on top of Your first Account, We
          will block or close the Account. We may also block or close Your first
          Account. If We leave Your first Account open Your remaining deposits
          from any other Accounts, if any, will be transferred to Your first
          Account. We will deduct an administrative fee of 10% (minimum EUR 50)
          for every other Account opened. We may also deduct further fees under
          these Rules.
        </li>
        <li>
          If We find there is more than one Account registered for Your
          household We will block or close any Accounts for that household.
        </li>
        <li>
          We may share Your personal and payment information with other people
          or businesses to check that You are who You say You are and for any
          verification procedures that We require.
        </li>
        <li>
          We do not give credit. Any balance on Your Account will not bear
          interest. We will not be treated as a financial institution.
        </li>
        <li>
          If You are found to be using the Website in any way for which it is
          not intended in order to gain money, We will adjust Your Account to
          remove any money gained from such activity and the Account may be
          permanently closed.
        </li>
        <li>
          We can refuse, terminate or limit any bet or wager for any reason.
        </li>
        <li>
          We will declare a bet or stake partially or fully void (and/or close
          Your Account) if We believe that any of the following apply:

            <li>
              You, or people associated with You may have directly or indirectly
              influenced the outcome of an event.
            </li>
            <li>
              You, or people associated with You may have access to insider
              knowledge that can influence the outcome of an event.
            </li>
            <li>
              You, or people associated with You are engaged in arbitrage or
              matched betting.
            </li>
            <li>
              You and or people associated with You directly or indirectly
              ignore the Rules.
            </li>
            <li>
              The result of an event has been directly or indirectly affected by
              criminal activity.
            </li>
            <li>
              A significant change in odds happened, for example due to a public
              announcement in relation to an event.
            </li>
            <li>
              Bets have been offered, placed and/or accepted that We would not
              have accepted, due to a technical issue affecting the Site at that
              point in time or a mistake, misprint and/or anything which is
              outside Our control.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          We may close Your Account, cancel and/or refund any of Your winnings
          found in the “Available to Bet” balance, (after the deduction of any
          withdrawal charges), withhold winnings and/or apply debits as required
          (in relation to damage caused by You) without any obligation to state
          a reason or give any notice. If We do this, all valid contractual
          obligations in place at the time of closure will be honoured.
        </li>
        <li>
          If We suspect that You are involved in illegal or fraudulent
          activities relating to Your use of the Site (or a third party's use of
          the Site) or are in trouble with creditors or are involved in any
          other behaviour detrimental to the Site, We may freeze or close Your
          Account and/or cancel stakes.
        </li>
        <li>
          We offer fair, open and transparent progressive jackpots on specific
          games for players who use its services for entertainment purposes
          only. In cases where We suspect that a game's or promotion's intended
          spirit is abused, We reserve the right to suspend, or cancel entirely,
          Your access to the game in question. Should We find it necessary, We
          may also close Your Account with immediate effect. Where Your Account
          has been terminated, We shall not be liable for any losses up to the
          point the Account was closed, nor will We consider any refunds on
          balances remaining on the Account. 'Abuse' is defined as, but not
          limited to, software-aided play on multiple games concurrently to
          generate more rounds of a game that could not be done naturally by a
          human player playing alone. Also, the practice of 'cherry-picking'
          games with 'value' jackpots, to the rank exclusion of all other games,
          will be considered an abuse of the spirit in which the jackpot is
          intended. In all cases where abuse has been proven beyond a reasonable
          doubt, We retain the right to confiscate all of the winnings and any
          balance remaining on the Account.

        <li>
          All transactions will be monitored and/or reviewed to prevent money
          laundering.
