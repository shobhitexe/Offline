          You may choose to completely exclude yourself from playing any of the
          Games on Our Site. To do so You must login and go to the
          Self-Exclusion page. For residents outside of the United Kingdom, You
          stipulate the period You wish to be self-excluded for and Your Account
          will automatically be reactivated. If You are resident in the United
          Kingdom, self-exclusion will apply for a minimum of 6 months and You
          must then contact customer support to have Your Account reactivated.

          You will not be able to open any Account with the Site should You opt
          for self exclusion. You will also forfeit any entry into any
          competition or draw which was entered into prior to such self
          -exclusion as well as forfeiting any noncash prizes or invitations
          which have been granted to You or offered to You prior to such
          self-exclusion but which have not yet been redeemed or utilised by You
          (for example, where tickets for an event have been offered but the
          event is to take place during a self-exclusion period, the invitation
          is automatically withdrawn upon self-exclusion) . This is to prevent
          gambling being promoted to You in a time where You have taken some
          time to assess Your gambling behaviour.

          You may also choose to “cool off” if you are a UK resident. You may
          want to take a break from gambling and a 'cooling off period' can be
          set for a period of: 24 hours, 1 week, 3 weeks or 6 weeks. Please
          contact support or visit this link when logged in to request a cool
          off period. At the end of any cool off period, Your Account will
          automatically be reactivated.

          Other If We believe that gambling will cause You financial or personal
          difficulties, We may close Your Account. You must not open a new
          Account. If You do so, it will be at Your own risk and We cannot be
          held liable.
